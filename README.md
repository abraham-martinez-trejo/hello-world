# hello-world

Hi Humans!

My name is Abraham Martinez, and I like c, and c++. 
I eat, breathe, and sleep art, engineering, science, and technology!
I have seen many places, but none like the cyberspace universe.

interactionmanager.h and interactionmanager.cpp were written a little before October 25th, 2016.
